Welcome to the BONELAB Guide Index! This site acts as a mirror for our public repository hosted on GitHub.

Here you can find community-created guides created by other modders to help assist you with content creation.

## Pre-Requisites

A lot of these docs will operate under the assumption that you have a Unity project setup with the latest [Marrow ExtendedSDK](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-MAINTAINED) scripts - which may extend the base SDK created by SLZ, and provides you with scripts they internally that aren't otherwise available for mod makers.

## Ready to Search?

You can browse through everything that's available on the explorer, or use the search bar to find what you're looking for. You search for keywords, and also search for certain types of content using #hashtags, such as #extendedsdk.
