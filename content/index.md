Welcome to BONELAB Modding Guides Site! This site mirrors the [bl-modding-guides](https://github.com/Lava-Pals/bl-modding-guides) repository on GitHub - a community-ran project that contains resources for modding BONELAB.

Some guides may operate under the assumption that you have a Unity project setup with the [Marrow Extended SDK Maintained](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-MAINTAINED) scripts.
